Is the Blackfin the sender or the receiver (or both) in this scenario?
 
We have seen numbers up to 11MBytes/sec, obviously depending on buffer sizes, network activity, available processor bandwidth, etc.
 
LwIP can be configured depending on your application requirements. LwIP is statically configurable, and most of the options can be changed in 'lwipopts.h' present in "...\Blackfin\lib\src\lwip\contrib\ports\adsp-blackfin\proj\lwipv4lib\". A modified version, 'lwipopts.big.h', is provided for applications that potentially transfer large amounts of TCP data. Some critical changes in 'lwipopts.big.h' from that of the default 'lwipopts.h' include:
        -RAM size increased from 64K to 1MB
        -TCP window size increased from 8K to 32K
        -Send Queue Length changed from 16 to 256.
